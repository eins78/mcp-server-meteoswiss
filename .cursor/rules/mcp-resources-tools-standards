MCP Resources and Tools Standards

# MCP Resources and Tools Standards

When implementing MCP Resources or Tools:

- Resources should be client-controlled, read-only data providers
- Tools should be model-controlled functions with clear parameters
- Implementation MUST use the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript SDK)
- Follow the schemas defined in docs/analysis/data-schema.md
- Ensure each Tool and Resource has a clear, concise description
- Document authentication requirements in the implementation
- Use the `McpServer` class from the SDK for server setup

Reference the API design document for complete specifications.
