# MeteoSwiss MCP Server Commit Message Guidelines

When creating commit messages, always follow these standards:

1. Start with a concise summary line (50-72 characters)
2. Leave one blank line after the summary
3. Provide a detailed description in the body
4. Focus on explaining WHY changes were made, not WHAT was changed
5. Document any non-obvious implementation details or workarounds
6. Reference issue numbers where applicable

Example:
```
Add station metadata caching to improve API response time

Implemented in-memory caching layer to reduce database load for 
frequently requested station metadata. Required custom serialization 
due to complex nested objects.

Fixes #123
```
