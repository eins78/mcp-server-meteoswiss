# MeteoSwiss MCP Server Commit Message Guidelines

When creating commit messages, always follow these standards:

1. Start with a concise summary line (50-72 characters), first character lowercase
2. prefer simple words (like "add" instead of "implement" and "update" instead of "enhance")
3. Leave one blank line after the summary
4. Provide a detailed description in the body
5. Focus on explaining WHY changes were made, not WHAT was changed. Dont mention changes that are obvious from reading the git diff.
6. Document any non-obvious implementation details or workarounds
7. Reference issue numbers where applicable

Example:
```
Add station metadata caching to improve API response time

Implemented in-memory caching layer to reduce database load for 
frequently requested station metadata. Required custom serialization 
due to complex nested objects.

Fixes #123
```
