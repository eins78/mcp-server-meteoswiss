# Technology Stack and Architecture

This project follows these technical guidelines:

- Use Node.js v22 with TypeScript
- MUST import and use the MCP TypeScript SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
- All API endpoints MUST be implemented via the SDK's `McpServer` class
- Use Zod for schema validation and type generation
- Implement proper error handling with typed exceptions
- Follow the component architecture outlined in our docs

See the architecture overview for detailed guidance on components.
