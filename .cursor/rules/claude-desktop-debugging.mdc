Claude Desktop Debugging

# Claude Desktop Debugging Guidelines

When working on MCP servers that need to connect to Claude Desktop:

1. Always check the Claude Desktop logs at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/` for connection errors
2. Use `StdioServerTransport` from the MCP SDK for Claude Desktop integration
3. Use the `node:` prefix for Node.js built-in modules when working with ESM
4. Test your server locally before connecting to Claude Desktop
5. Ensure TypeScript is compiling to ES2022 or higher for modern syntax support

For detailed debugging steps, see [docs/debugging-guide.md](mdc:../../docs/debugging-guide.md)
