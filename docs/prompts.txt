i want to create a MCP ser@https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introductionthat ) that provides weather data as resource.
the goal is to give LLM users access to current weather data as well as forecasts and answer general questions ("where is it snowing?", "where will be a sunny day for hiking next saturday?", "whats the weather like in zurich today?" 

the data is publicly hosted via HTTP, mosty JSON files and some textdata is HTML format.
some content is available in multiple languages (de,fr,it,en).
in general the data is organized by location, mostly by zipcode (4 or 6 numbers, like 8001 or 800100 fur zurich).
the data is versioned by update time, with references in versions.json files. we always want to use the newest data.

lets start by making a plan.

* analyse the available data. i've downloaded a useful subset as a snapshot for the current date.  they are mostly UI-specific as this is not really an API but more of a "backend for frontend". so the analysis should identify which of the data would be most usefull for the MCP server (is ot complete? to big?). we only want to expose the most minimal subset of data for our use case, on not waste bandwidth.
@measured-values is current measurements (regularly updated) and the rest of the folders in @data-2025-03-26  are a mixture of current and forecast data

* identify any data we'll need that is missing from the data snapshot. for example if there is information missing about the geographical location of places, or a list of all places and there zip codes etc.

* lets keep records of our work as markdown files in this repo. make a "docs" folder or similar with appropriate subfolder. start with a small readme as an overview and a file for the results of the data analysis. 
we will later also add a software architecture overview for the actual server.

***

we will use nodejs v22, the TS SDK @https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk and @https://zod.dev for types.
use tsconfig best practices @https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet 

review the @docs  and make changes if needed.

***

the api design talks about "available tools". i would have expected that the MCP server only needs to expose Resources, why do we need Tools?

***

thanks, please make sure this is explained in the docs. keep it short, a summary is enough.

***

please generate appropriate cursor rules (@https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) for this project. 
we want to keep the workflow of always documenting our work â€“ for humans to read, but mostly for the LLM coding agents helping us. 
the rules should otherwise be simple and mostly refer to the docs we have, for example regarding the tech stack we'll use.

***

lets plan and implement a MVP-like small demo for our server.
just the bare minimum so i can test it with a MCP client, nothing else.
its doesnt even make HTTP requests and just reads the static files.

lets just use the "weather report" data.

generate the following:
* server code
* minimal dev docs in main README (how to run it)
* new md file with end-user docs (how to use it, what features are available)

***

lets add the config needed for our server to @claude_desktop_config.json 
see docs @https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server 

***

the server should have used @https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk 

please first check the docs and cursor rules and explain why the SDK was not used and fix the rules/docs before making changes to the code.

***

please add to our rules and docs information how to debug claude desktop. dont make any other changes.

***

i fixed the @claude_desktop_config.json to the MVP should start correctly.
now i get new error. check @MCP

let's add more dev rules and implement them

commit messages: always start with a short summary and then more details after an empty line. in the body don't give an comprehensive overview of the changes visible in the diff, instead state goals and non-obvious details like workaround that were needed. 

***

let's add more dev rules and implement them

use pnpm instead of npm. check docs @https://pnpm.io/pnpm-cli 

***

we dont need an .npmrc, just using default settings

***

let's add more dev rules and implement them

use node 23 with native typescript. use an .nvrm file for developers.

goal is to not have a build step at all, but still have a "lint" command that does typechecking.

here are some info and docs about this feature:
* @https://www.totaltypescript.com/typescript-is-coming-to-node-23 
* @https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively 
* @https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v23.x/api/typescript.html 

***

remove the `check-node-version.js` script and usage and use `engine` field in @package.json to request node 23.11 or later

***

server does not start anymore, please fix the file imports as well
