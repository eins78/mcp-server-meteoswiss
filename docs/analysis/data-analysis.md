# MeteoSwiss Data Analysis

This document analyzes the available MeteoSwiss data to determine which parts are most useful for the MCP server implementation.

## Overview of Available Data

The test fixture data contains the following main categories:

1. **Measured Values**: Current and historical weather measurements
2. **Weather Outlook**: Medium-range forecast text
3. **Weather Pill**: Quick current conditions and short-term forecasts
4. **Weather Report**: Detailed report for regions
5. **Weather Widget**: Widget data for UI displays
6. **Weather Region Overview**: Regional overview information

## Data Analysis by Category

### 1. Measured Values

The measured values data is organized into several subcategories:

#### ChartData

Contains time series data for various weather parameters. Each parameter has hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly measurements where applicable. Parameters include:

- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Wind
- Humidity
- Sunshine
- Snow
- Air pressure
- Radiation
- Pollen

The data is organized by station code (e.g., GVE for Geneva) and is available in multiple languages (de, fr, it, en).

**Example structure**: The temperature hour data contains timestamps and temperature values for a specific station.

**Assessment**: Highly valuable for current conditions and historical context. The hourly data is most useful for recent/current measurements.

#### StationMeta

Contains metadata about the weather stations, including:

- Station name and ID
- Coordinates
- Altitude
- Available measurements
- Data history

**Assessment**: Essential for providing location context to measurements.

#### Params

Contains parameter definitions and metadata that describe the meaning of the various measurements.

**Assessment**: Important for providing accurate descriptions of measurements.

### 2. Weather Pill

Contains current conditions and forecasts for specific locations. The data is organized by numerical IDs (likely postal codes) and includes:

- Current temperature (high/low)
- Weather symbol ID
- Location name and coordinates
- Forecast data for the next 9 days

**Assessment**: Very valuable for providing concise forecasts for specific locations. The forecast includes temperature (high/low) and weather conditions represented by symbol IDs.

### 3. Weather Outlook

Contains textual forecasts by region (north, south, west) in multiple languages. These are medium-range outlooks.

**Assessment**: Useful for providing natural language descriptions of future weather patterns.

### 4. Weather Report

Contains detailed textual weather reports by region in multiple languages.

**Assessment**: Valuable for providing detailed natural language descriptions of current and future weather.

## Data Selection for MCP Server

Based on the analysis, the most valuable datasets for the MCP server are:

1. **ChartData hourly measurements**: For current weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
2. **StationMeta**: For location information and available measurements
3. **Weather Pill**: For location-specific forecasts
4. **Weather Outlook/Report**: For natural language descriptions

## Data Gaps

Some potential gaps in the data include:

1. **Location Mapping**: There's no clear mapping between place names, zip codes, and station IDs. We may need to create or source this mapping.
2. **Weather Symbol Mapping**: We need a mapping between weather symbol IDs and their meanings.
3. **Geographical Coverage**: We should verify that the data covers all significant locations in Switzerland.

## Next Steps

1. Create a schema for the data to be exposed via the MCP server
2. Implement data transformation from the raw sources to the MCP resources
3. Source or create any missing mapping data
4. Design the resource interfaces for the MCP server
