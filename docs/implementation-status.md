# MeteoSwiss MCP Server Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of different features and components of the MeteoSwiss MCP Server.

## Weather Report Tool

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic Structure | ✅ Complete | Initial implementation |
| HTTP Data Fetching | ✅ Complete | Enhanced to fetch data from MeteoSwiss HTTP endpoints |
| Integration Tests | ✅ Complete | Added tests with local test fixtures |
| Error Handling | ✅ Complete | Added comprehensive error handling for HTTP requests |

### Implementation Details

1. ✅ Updated `weather-report-data.ts` to fetch data from HTTP endpoints
2. ✅ Created HTTP client utility with proper error handling and retries
3. ✅ Added clean separation between production and test code
4. ✅ Added integration tests with local test fixtures
5. ✅ Updated documentation

### HTTP Endpoints

- Base URL: `https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/product/output/`
- Weather Report: `https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/product/output/weather-report/`

### Implementation Notes

The Weather Report tool implementation follows these principles:

1. **Production Mode**: Fetches data directly from MeteoSwiss HTTP endpoints
2. **Test Mode**: Uses local fixtures to ensure reliable and consistent tests
3. **Clean Separation**: Production and test code paths are clearly separated

The implementation includes dedicated test fixtures that mimic the structure of the real data without depending on the vendor data. The HTTP client includes proper error handling and retry mechanisms for production use.

Integration tests ensure that the tool correctly processes the data, making the tests reliable and independent of external services.
